# Tiny Habits

## Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In the video, the most interesting idea is the power of tiny habits to enhance happiness and gratitude. Similar to concepts in a book "Atomic Habits" which I have read, the speaker shares his story of that he adopted small daily practices, like writing down three things he is thankful for each morning. This simple act significantly improved his mindset and overall well-being, reinforcing how small changes can lead to profound effects on happiness.
