# Tiny Habits

## Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

In the video, the most interesting idea is the power of tiny habits to enhance happiness and gratitude. Similar to concepts in a book "Atomic Habits" which I have read, the speaker shares his story of that he adopted small daily practices, like writing down three things he is thankful for each morning. This simple act significantly improved his mindset and overall well-being, reinforcing how small changes can lead to profound effects on happiness.

 ## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

 The B = MAP formula simplifies habit formation by focusing on three components:

- **M (Motivation):** Connect the habit to a personal goal to boost motivation.
- **A (Ability):** Make the habit easy to perform, like starting small (e.g., a few pages of reading).
- **P (Prompt):** Use a trigger, such as linking a new habit to an existing one (e.g., meditating after brushing teeth).
By aligning motivation, ability, and prompts, habit-building becomes more sustainable.

## Question 3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

- **Celebration Creates Positive Emotions:** Positive emotions wire the habit into your brain, making you more likely to repeat it.
- **Strengthens the Habit:** Each celebration reinforces the neural pathways, making the habit automatic over time.
- **Boosts Motivation:** Celebrating wins shifts focus to progress, increasing motivation and confidence.
- **Celebration as a Tiny Habit:** Treat celebrating like a habit by making it small and consistent.
- **Strengthens Relationships:** Sharing celebrations fosters stronger bonds and encourages future success.
