## Ques-1: What is Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

Learn with the mindset that you are gonna teach the topic to small child, that will enable you to learn the topic in depth.

## Ques-2: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The pinball story was relatable to me because I know about concious and subconsious mind, when we try to learn something new then our mind is making new neuraal connections which is called working with the concious mind, and when we are relaxed (diffused state) our brain starts the process of killing useless neural connections and create some fast and closely coupled neural connections to make make the transfer of information more fast which directly enables the process of birth of hunches(new thought or solution of the problem).

## Ques-3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active and Diffused modes are the two modes in which brain process thoughts.
