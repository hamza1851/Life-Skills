## Ques-1: What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line.

Learn with the mindset that you are going to teach the topic to a small child. This will enable you to understand the topic in depth.

## Ques-2: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The pinball story was relatable to me because I know about the conscious and subconscious mind. When we try to learn something new, our brain makes new neural connections, which is called working with the conscious mind. When we are relaxed (diffused state), our brain begins the process of eliminating useless neural connections and creating fast, closely coupled neural connections. This makes the transfer of information quicker, directly enabling the birth of hunches (new thoughts or solutions to problems).

## Ques-3: What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active and diffused modes are the two ways in which the brain processes thoughts.

- **Active mode**: This mode is when a person is trying to solve a problem or doing something with focus.
- **Diffused mode**: This mode activates when a person is relaxed and shifts their focus away from the task they were trying to do. It enables the brain to work on the problem in the subconscious mind.

## Ques-4: According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

**When learning a new topic, the steps should be:**

- Deconstruct the skill
- Learn enough to self-correct
- Remove practice barriers
- Practice for at least 20 hours

## Ques-5: What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?

- Keep distractions away from yourself, such as your phone, social media apps, etc.
- Learn about the jargon in the topic until you fully understand it.
- Use the Pomodoro Technique to increase focus and remind yourself to take breaks for your brain to process the information.
- Use the Feynman Technique.
- Once you've finished a topic, try to teach it to someone else. This helps your brain rewire neural connections and enables the creation of closer connections.
